                    This is a blog post meant to many people who have ever tried to start competitive programming, but didn't find where to go ahead and left in midway. And also to those who wonders where to start from.Before talking about competitive programming I would like to talk about what is Competitive Programming?
                </p>
                <h3><b>Competitive Programming</b></h3>

                <p>
                    Generally competitive programming is a mind sport where everyone showcase his/her skills of problem solving under various constraints(that force everyone to think deeply or efficiently). Anyone who does competitive programming can enhance his/her problem solving approaches.You will learn how to approach a problem with the best of the best possible ways, you will learn how to analytically think and solve a problem and analyze it's space and time complexity.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        <h4 class="h-style">Patience:</h4>
                        <p>
                            Most important thing you need to learn is patience while doing the problems. Anyone who starts competitive programming as a beginner face impatience, and the reason behind this is that he/she is not getting the AC(the most awaited green sign) on some problems even after trying that problem since last 2 or more days, and this leads into the impatience. I have met many people who starts the competitive programming and left it just after a week, and the reason will surprise you, they all left the competitive programming because of impatience and they all used to say that we can't waste our time on a single problem for more than few hours.So please you need to patience and gradually you will surely feel the improvement in solving problems.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4 class="h-style"> Do participate regularly in contest:
 </h4>
                        <p>
                           Please do participate regularly in as many as contest you can, why because participating in the contests you will learn many new topics and will get experienced how to fight with the programmers from across the globe.But please make sure as a beginner you will face some difficulties while solving the problems in any ongoing contest because there will be some pressure of getting ranked above your competitors.Sometimes you will also find decrement in your rating, but please don't get demotivated or discouraged everyone have gone through all these things to become a successful programmer,rating is just a matter of time as the time will pass and you will keep practicing,then you will see increment in your rating

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4 class="h-style"> Always Be Curious. </h4>
                        <p>
                            A competitive programmer has to keep himself/herself updated continuously with the new problems and algorithms in the field. You need to take a proactive stand and learn new things.Following are some of the most informative and useful learning sources for competitive programmers -
                        </p>
                        <ul class="sources">
                            <li> <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank"> LeetCode </a> </li>
                            <li> <a href="https://codeforces.com" target="_blank"> Code Forces</a> </li>
                            <li> <a href="https://codechef.com/" target="_blank"> Code Chef</a> </li>
                            <li> <a href="https://atcoder.jp/" target="_blank"> At Coder</a> </li>
                            <li> <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam" target="_blank"> Google Code Jam</a> </li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4 class="h-style"> Get your hands dirty in Data Structures: </h4>
                        <p>
                           Data Structures are something that helps you in making the program more efficient. Having good amount of knowledge in Data Structures will help you in selecting the optimal Data Structure for any problem. Anyone can learn Data Structures from GeeksForGeeks, it contains Data Structures tutorials and problems in rich amount.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4 class="h-style"> Get your hands dirty in Algorithms:</h4>
                        <p>
                           Algorithms are something that use various data structures to implement the logic and then we get the result in form of output produced by the algorithm. You need to be very good in Algorithms, again GeeksForGeeks contains Algorithms in rich amount.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Always try to think of the most optimal solution, that is, one which runs with least time complexity and occupies minimum space.

                        Sorting: You must have heard of a number of sorting techniques to sort but while doing Competitive Programming most of those techniques prove to be time-consuming hence the STL library comes to rescue, it offers a function sort() which sorts the array in the most optimal way.
                        </p>
                    </li>
    
                </ol>
                   <p>
                        So to master the Competitive Programming you need dedication, patience and continuous practice to solve the problems as many as you can.
                        Code,sleep,eat and repeat.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Happy coding!</strong>
